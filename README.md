# Motion Tracking Example

## Overview

This project/repository serves as a template for building projects or extensions based on Isaac Lab.
It allows you to develop in an isolated environment, outside of the core Isaac Lab repository.

**Keywords:** extension, template, isaaclab

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab v2.3.0 by following
  the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html). We recommend
  using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e., outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

```bash
# Option 1: SSH
git clone git@github.com:leggedrobotics/isaaclab-spinning-up.git

# Option 2: HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/isaaclab-spinning-up.git
```

- Pull the robot description files from GCS

```bash
# Enter the repository
cd isaaclab-spinning-up
# Rename all occurrences of whole_body_tracking (in files/directories) to your_fancy_extension_name
curl -L -o unitree_description.tar.gz https://storage.googleapis.com/qiayuanl_robot_descriptions/unitree_description.tar.gz && \
tar -xzf unitree_description.tar.gz -C source/motion_tracking/data && \
rm unitree_description.tar.gz
```

- Using a Python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/whole_body_tracking
```

## Motion Tracking

### Motion Preprocessing & Registry Setup

In order to manage the large set of motions we used in this work, we leverage the WandB registry to store and load
reference motions automatically.
Note: The reference motion should be retargeted and use generalized coordinates only.

- Gather the reference motion datasets (please follow the original licenses), we use the same convention as .csv of
  Unitree's dataset

    - Unitree-retargeted LAFAN1 Dataset is available
      on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lvhaidong/LAFAN1_Retargeting_Dataset)
    - Sidekicks are from [KungfuBot](https://kungfu-bot.github.io/)
    - Christiano Ronaldo celebration is from [ASAP](https://github.com/LeCAR-Lab/ASAP).
    - Balance motions are from [HuB](https://hub-robot.github.io/)


- Log in to your WandB account; access Registry under Core on the left. Create a new registry collection with the name "
  Motions" and artifact type "All Types".


- Convert retargeted motions to include the maximum coordinates information (body pose, body velocity, and body
  acceleration) via forward kinematics,

```bash
python scripts/motions/pkl_to_csv.py \
    --pkl-file source/motion_tracking/data/motions/pkl/g1_spinkick.pkl \
    --csv-file source/motion_tracking/data/motions/csv/g1_spinkick.csv \
    --duration 2.65 \
    --add-start-transition \
    --add-end-transition \
    --transition-duration 0.5 \
    --pad-duration 1.0
```

```bash
python scripts/motions/csv_to_npz.py \
  --input_file source/motion_tracking/data/motions/csv/g1_spinkick.csv \
  --input_fps 30 \
  --output_name source/motion_tracking/data/motions/npz/g1_spinkick.npz \
  --output_fps 50 \
  --headless
```

- Debugging
    - Make sure to export WANDB_ENTITY to your organization name, not your personal username.
    - If /tmp folder is not accessible, modify csv_to_npz.py L319 & L326 to a temporary folder of your choice.

### Policy Training

- Train policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
--registry_name {your-organization}-org/wandb-registry-motions/{motion_name} \
--headless --logger wandb --log_project_name {project_name} --run_name {run_name}
```

### Policy Evaluation

- Play the trained policy by the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 --num_envs=2 --wandb_path={wandb-run-path}
```

The WandB run path can be located in the run overview. It follows the format {your_organization}/{project_name}/ along
with a unique 8-character identifier. Note that run_name is different from run_path.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
  We recommend using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone or copy this project/repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:

    ```bash
    # use 'PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
    python -m pip install -e source/humanoid_motion_tracking

- Verify that the extension is correctly installed by:

    - Listing the available tasks:

        Note: It the task name changes, it may be necessary to update the search pattern `"Template-"`
        (in the `scripts/list_envs.py` file) so that it can be listed.

        ```bash
        # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
        python scripts/list_envs.py
        ```

    - Running a task:

        ```bash
        # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
        python scripts/<RL_LIBRARY>/train.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
        ```

    - Running a task with dummy agents:

        These include dummy agents that output zero or random agents. They are useful to ensure that the environments are configured correctly.

        - Zero-action agent

            ```bash
            # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
            python scripts/zero_agent.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
            ```
        - Random-action agent

            ```bash
            # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
            python scripts/random_agent.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
            ```

### Set up IDE (Optional)

To setup the IDE, please follow these instructions:

- Run VSCode Tasks, by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, selecting `Tasks: Run Task` and running the `setup_python_env` in the drop down menu.
  When running this task, you will be prompted to add the absolute path to your Isaac Sim installation.

If everything executes correctly, it should create a file .python.env in the `.vscode` directory.
The file contains the python paths to all the extensions provided by Isaac Sim and Omniverse.
This helps in indexing all the python modules for intelligent suggestions while writing code.

## Code formatting

We have a pre-commit template to automatically format your code.
To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then you can run pre-commit with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
